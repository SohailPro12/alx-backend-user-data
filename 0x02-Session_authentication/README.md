### 1. What Authentication Means
**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It's about confirming that the person or system is who they claim to be. This is usually done through credentials such as usernames and passwords, but can also involve other factors like biometric data or multi-factor authentication (MFA).

### 2. What Session Authentication Means
**Session Authentication** refers to maintaining a user's authenticated state across multiple requests during a session. When a user logs in, a server creates a session for them, which often involves generating a unique session identifier (session ID). This ID is used to recognize the user on subsequent requests, so they don’t have to log in repeatedly. The session data might be stored on the server or client-side, depending on the implementation.

### 3. What Cookies Are
**Cookies** are small pieces of data that a server sends to a user's web browser, which stores them and sends them back to the server with subsequent requests. Cookies are commonly used to manage sessions, store user preferences, or track user behavior.

### 4. How to Send Cookies
**Sending Cookies** typically involves the server setting a `Set-Cookie` header in the HTTP response. Here’s a basic example:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; Path=/; HttpOnly
```

In this example, the server sets a cookie named `sessionId` with the value `abc123`. The `Path` attribute specifies that the cookie is available to all paths on the domain, and `HttpOnly` makes the cookie inaccessible to JavaScript, enhancing security.

### 5. How to Parse Cookies
**Parsing Cookies** involves extracting cookie data from HTTP requests. In a server-side application, you typically access cookies via request headers. For instance, in Python with Flask:

```python
from flask import request

@app.route('/')
def index():
    user_id = request.cookies.get('userId')
    return f'User ID is {user_id}'
```

In this example, `request.cookies.get('userId')` retrieves the value of the `userId` cookie sent by the client.

### Requirements
- **Understanding the Purpose**: Know why you’re using cookies and sessions, such as managing user authentication, preferences, or tracking.
- **Security Considerations**: Ensure cookies are used securely by setting attributes like `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` to prevent issues like XSS and CSRF attacks.
- **Proper Handling**: Implement correct handling for creating, sending, and parsing cookies and managing session lifecycles.
